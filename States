When a festrog takes damage from a piercing or slashing weapon, some of its boils rupture, squirting the attacker with puslike fluids. The noxious secretions carry a potent contact disease that causes those infected to break out into painful necrotic boils.

Necrotic Boils: Diseaseâ€”contact; save Fort DC 11; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con; cure 1 save.

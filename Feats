Ninja Trick:

Bleeding Attack* (Ex)
Benefit: A ninja with this trick can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack.

The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage.

 A ninja with this trick receives a +10 insight bonus on this Heal check.

 Redirect Force (Ex)

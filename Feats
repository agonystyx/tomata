Ninja Trick:

Bleeding Attack* (Ex)
Benefit: A ninja with this trick can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack.

The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage.

 Redirect Force (Ex)
Benefit: If the ninja has a feat that allows her to attempt a combat maneuver without provoking attacks of opportunity, she can choose to provoke them anyway when she performs that maneuver.

DESCRIPTION

You create a shallow extra-dimensional hole perfectly sized to trip anyone who steps within it. This hole occupies a single 5-foot square with a depth of six inches. Any creature occupying the square when you first create the hole, or who later steps into the square containing the hole, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling prone in an adjacent square and taking 1d6 points of damage. A creature that makes its saving throw still stumbles ever so slightly and takes a -1 penalty on all rolls and checks for 1 round. The spell has no effect on creatures adjacent to the square containing the hole.

Outslug Style
When you take a 5-foot step, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on weapon damage rolls with the chosen weapon until the beginning of your next turn.


Step Up (Combat)
You can close the distance when a foe tries to move away.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.
Benefit: Whenever an adjacent foe attempts to take a 5-foot step away from you, you may also make a 5-foot step as an immediate action so long as you end up adjacent to the foe that triggered this ability. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement.

After another flash, Vrood’s hands place 5 strange items into a chest—

an iron-and-glass vial containing a swirling gray mist, a bloody heart inside a glass bottle, a crystal shard glowing blood red with black streaks swirling around it, a ragged collection of parchment as if pages torn from a book, and a fragile skull composed of hundreds of bone fragments. Into a second chest he places a strange statuette of murky green stone
depicting a grotesque, tentacled creature.

Another f lash.
The chests are given to two riders in dark cloaks on pale horses. “Ride to Thrushmoor,” you hear Vrood’s voic speak. “Our agent will exchange the Effigy for the last relic
we need while our other agents acquire the second to last piece in Carrion Hill. After a final flash, the visions fade.

You look for every edge when flanking an enemy.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +4.

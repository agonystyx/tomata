Snapping Flank	Combat, Teamwork	BAB +9, bite attack	Whenever you are flanking with an ally who also has this feat, as a swift action you can make a bite attack against the opponent you and your ally are flanking.

 (COMBAT)
Acrobatic

Improved Feint

Outslug Style
When you take a 5-foot step, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on weapon damage rolls with the chosen weapon until the beginning of your next turn.


Step Up (Combat)
You can close the distance when a foe tries to move away.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.
Benefit: Whenever an adjacent foe attempts to take a 5-foot step away from you, you may also make a 5-foot step as an immediate action so long as you end up adjacent to the foe that triggered this ability. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement.

After another flash, Vrood’s hands place 5 strange items into a chest—

an iron-and-glass vial containing a swirling gray mist, a bloody heart inside a glass bottle, a crystal shard glowing blood red with black streaks swirling around it, a ragged collection of parchment as if pages torn from a book, and a fragile skull composed of hundreds of bone fragments. Into a second chest he places a strange statuette of murky green stone
depicting a grotesque, tentacled creature.

Another f lash.
The chests are given to two riders in dark cloaks on pale horses. “Ride to Thrushmoor,” you hear Vrood’s voic speak. “Our agent will exchange the Effigy for the last relic
we need while our other agents acquire the second to last piece in Carrion Hill. After a final flash, the visions fade.

Thrushmoor exchange effigy for relic

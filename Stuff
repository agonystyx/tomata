Flayleaf
EDIT
Flayleaf is a wiry shrub with reddish-brown leaves that grows in almost any temperate environment. Leaves are harvested and dried, and when smoked produce a powerful sedative and hallucinogenic effect similar to drunkenness. [1] Harvesting the leaves of this drug are dangerous due to the Flayleaf spiders that live on the plants.[1]

Flayleaf as a Drug
It is also a powerful analgesic and muscle relaxant, rendering the user immune to most pain for up to four hours. It also causes the user to become very susceptible to suggestion.[1] The berries of the flayleaf plant are sometimes crushed and mixed with dream spider venom and spiderberry tea to produce a potent hallucinogen called Riddleport Tea.[2] Unlike its cousin, the cabble-weed, flayleaf is highly addictive.[3] Cost varies across regions with a full pouch of it going for around 12 gp in the highly permissive city of Riddleport in Varisia.[4]

  MASTERWORK TOOL

Price 50 gp; Weight 1 lb.

This tool is perfect for its intended job. It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on a related skill check (if any). The bonuses provided by multiple masterwork items do not stack.

Several common items already count as masterwork tools for particular skills. These are the alchemist's lab, climber's kit, disguise kit, healer's kit, masterwork musical instrument, and masterwork thieves' tools. Therefore, there is no masterwork climber's kit, masterwork healer's kit, and so on—those items are already the best available for general checks with the relevant skill.

Some skills have no appropriate tool or masterwork tool—no nonmagical item exists that grants a bonus for all uses of that skill. For example, just because a certain perfume is favored by local nobles (granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence them) doesn't mean that perfume has the same effect on a member of the thieves' guild, a foreign berserker, or a medusa. Likewise, just because a fake beard woven by dwarves out of the beards of famous dwarves may grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Magic Device checks to emulate the dwarven race doesn't mean the beard has any effect on using that skill to activate elven items or paladin items, or to decipher a written spell.

Individual GMs may want to allow masterwork tools for other skills at the listed cost. The circumstance bonus for such a tool should never be more than +2. The tool should either have a limited number of uses (such as the disguise and healer's kits) or only apply to certain aspects of the skill (such as the balancing pole's bonus on Acrobatics checks to traverse a narrow surface or the magnifying glass's bonus on Appraise checks for detailed items).


Boots of the Cat
Aura faint transmutation; CL 1st; Slot feet; Price 1,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

DESCRIPTION

These high-soled blue boots provide a great deal of comfort and arch support while also making the wearer appear a little bit taller than normal.

The boot’s wearer always takes the minimum possible damage from falls (as if the GM had rolled a 1 on each die of damage incurred by the fall) and at the end of a fall always lands on his feet.

CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS

Feats Craft Wondrous Item, feather fall; Cost 500 gp.


Burst of Speed: A solid spell from Ultimate Combat, this spell seems a little weak for a 3rd-level spell slot at first glance. As a swift action you gain a 20 foot bonus to your speed (untyped), or a 10 foot bonus if you're wearing medium or heavy armor. The advantage is that your movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, and you can move through spaces of creatures larger than you as long as you don't end your movement there. Again, it's only usable on the self, but it's a handy trick to have up your sleeve if you need to close with an enemy (or get behind them for a flank) in a big damn hurry.


Haste: Everyone's favorite party boosting spell, haste adds 30 feet to a person's movement in all forms. This counts as an enhancement bonus, so it won't stack with other enhancement bonuses. However, it has the advantage that it can affect several people at once, and that it will boost party members who can fly, swim, burrow, climb, etc. It also eats a 2nd or 3rd level spell slot, depending on your casting class, so you can keep it in spell-completion form, too, should you need it.

- Expeditious Retreat: A lower-level way to give yourself a 30-foot bonus to your speed, expeditious retreat is also treated as an enhancement bonus. It lasts for minutes per level, and it's a great way to get around the limitations placed on you because of heavier armor, shorter movement speeds from size, etc. And, despite the name, you can use this spell to move into an attack position if that's what you'd rather do!

EXPEDITIOUS RETREAT
  School transmutation; Level alchemist 1, bard 1, inquisitor 1, magus 1, psychic 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, summoner/unchained summoner 1; Subdomain azata (chaos, good) 1, exploration 1
  Casting Time 1 standard action
  Components V, S
  Range personal
  Target you
  Duration 1 min./level (D)
  This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Acrobatics skill).



---- Notes -----
ANATOMY DOLL
  Aura faint necromancy; CL 5th; Slot none; Price 1,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.
  This stuffed rag doll might resemble a child’s toy if not for the vital organs depicted on its cloth.
  By dabbing the doll with a few drops of blood from a living creature (a standard action), the bearer can form a sympathetic link between the doll and the victim.
  If the chosen victim has spell resistance, the doll must beat the target’s spell resistance to create the link. As a standard action, the bearer can twist or stab the doll; this gives the target the sickened condition for one round and deals 1 point of negative energy damage plus 1 point for each die of the doll bearer’s sneak attack damage (if any).
  Each time the target is affected by the doll, it receives a DC 14 Will save to end the link. The doll’s holder needs line of effect to the victim, but not line of sight. Once linked to a particular creature, an anatomy doll cannot be linked to another creature, but the bearer can re-establish a broken link by anointing it with more of the target’s blood.
  Feats Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse, bleed Cost 500 gp.

BOOTS OF ELVENKIND
  Aura faint transmutation; CL 5th; Slot feet; Price 2,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.
  These soft boots are partially made out of living leaves and other natural materials.
  They enable the wearer to move nimbly about in virtually any surroundings, granting a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks.
  Feats Craft Wondrous Item; Special creator must be an elf; Cost 1,250 gp.


MITHRAL

  Mithral is a rare, silvery metal that is lighter than steel but just as hard.
  When worked like steel, it can be used to create amazing armor, and is occasionally used for other items as well.
  Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations.
  Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light.
  This decrease does not apply to proficiency in wearing the armor.
  A character wearing mithral full plate must be proficient in wearing heavy armor to avoid adding the armor's check penalty on all his attack rolls and skill checks that involve moving.
  Spell failure chances for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonuses are increased by 2, and armor check penalties are decreased by 3 (to a minimum of 0).

  An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. In the case of weapons, this lighter weight does not change a weapon's size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether it is light, one-handed, or two-handed).
  Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of mithral. (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a quarterstaff cannot.)
  Mithral weapons count as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

  Weapons and armors fashioned from mithral are always masterwork items as well; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below.

  Mithral has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 15.

  Type of Mithral Item	Item Price Modifier
  Light armor	+1,000 gp
  Medium armor	+4,000 gp
  Heavy armor	+9,000 gp
  Shield	+1,500 gp
  Other items	+500 gp/lb.

CASTING

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S

EFFECT

Range touch
Target one creature touched
Duration 1 minute/level
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes (harmless)

DESCRIPTION

When casting this spell, choose a single skill that you have at least one rank in. The target gains a +2 insight bonus on skill checks with this skill and is considered trained in that skill. The insight bonus increases by 1 for every four levels of the caster (maximum +6). Furthermore, once before the spell’s duration, the target can choose to roll two checks and take the greater result. Doing so ends the spell’s other effects.
